# Keplerth-Moon-Elf-Mod
Mod for Keplerth. Not on Steam due to NSFW bits (and also because this is hardly a professional mod). Adds moon elf species to Keplerth playable races.
Moon elves are primarily a gathering-crafting type species and have some buffs to account for this, as well as some combat debuffs to go with it.

Sprites are reverse-engineered, due to Keplerth not making their texture assets public and easily moddable. For this reason, the sprites are not perfect by any means, and most notably have lost the shading the original sprites had.
